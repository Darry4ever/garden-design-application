# garden-design-application

## Design and code a garden design application in Java. 

It will graphically display a ‘garden’ in a JFrame window. 

• The ‘garden’ is contained in a JFrame. It should contain other components for graphics, painting etc.

• It has pretty grass background. 

• It will contain flowerbeds. 

Flowerbeds display rows of flowers. They can be all the same, or mixed.

• If mixed, they could be in patterns, or random. 

## It have the following functionality from a menu input system: 

• Flowerbed Display 
This is a JFrame window, containing a number of components (panels). Each component is a flowerbed displaying flowers, as shown in the example screenshot above. The number of rows and columns depends on the size of the flower images. When flowerbeds are added and removed, the display should be updated. 

• Add Flowerbed 
The user will be able to add a flowerbed to the display. They will be able to specify: 

- Flowerbed size, setting the height and width of the flowerbed. 

- Flowerbed location, setting the position on screen (x and y co-ordinates). 

- Type of flower (choosing from a menu of flower image file names, which are in a folder in your application project folder). 

They are able to display flowers in a pattern (as shown in the lower flowerbeds in the screenshot above). 

The user will be able to choose the type of pattern (eg squares or stripes) 
And also the details of the pattern, eg: 

• Horizontal or vertical stripes? 

• How many flowers wide are the stripes? 

• How many different colours or flowers for the stripes? 

Or similar details for squares etc. 

• Remove Flowerbed 

Using a command line menu, the user can remove flowerbeds from the display. 

• Save and exit 
The user will be able to select an exit option in the menu. This will automatically save the current state of the garden to a text file and exit the program. The file format must be a text (.txt) file. 

• Load file on startup 

When the program is started, garden data should be automatically loaded from a text file, and the display and flowerbeds should be restored to the state of the 
program when it was last exited. 

• Menu Interface
This is entirely menu driven, displayed through the console window and with keyboard input and all users' input	must be fully validated.
